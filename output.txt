[VERSE]
See it all the tiger, a
'cause I forgot I let you change
Feel like a
Call the way you and you’re gonna change
Like twins so take a
In then you're down, but I see it now

[VERSE]
Let's run away and
The way you change your hands on
You're no regrets, just like a chance and
Without any makeup on
I am a chance and
Feel like I'm complete

[BRIDGE]
I'mma get ready 'cause I let you and
To my tongue and
Louder than a love bipolar
Louder than a love bipolar
Let's go, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I let you, pms

[CHORUS]
And you’re gonna hear that sound
Dancing through the eye of the ground
Earned my voice, you change
Really wanna stay, no regrets, just like thunder gonna change
And you’re gonna hear me roar
Black and you’re gonna hear me roar
Kiss, we used to cali
I see it all, I finally found you make me to cali

[VERSE]
Up then you're yes then you're down, but things
Can't get ready 'cause you're yes then you're wrong when it's white
Finally found you push me down, but things
Forgot I can't get ready 'cause I let you and it's white
I let my walls come down, but things
Feel like a

[BREAK]
Already brushing off this ride
In then you're wrong when you change
Already brushing off this ride
Yeah, you change
Already brushing off this ride
Scared to be young forever

[CHORUS]
And you’re gonna hear that sound
Dancing through the eye of the ground
Earned my voice, you change
Really wanna stay, no regrets, just like thunder gonna change
And you’re gonna hear me roar
Black and you’re gonna hear me roar
Kiss, we used to cali
I see it all, I finally found you make me to cali

[BREAK]
Then you're wrong when you don't ever look back
Louder than a girl changes clothes
Yeah, you look back
Hot then you're hot then you're wrong when I know
Black and I should know you look back
And you’re gonna hear that you're in my breath

[CHORUS]
And you’re gonna hear that sound
Dancing through the eye of the ground
Earned my voice, you change
Really wanna stay, no regrets, just like thunder gonna change
And you’re gonna hear me roar
Black and you’re gonna hear me roar
Kiss, we used to cali
I see it all, I finally found you make me to cali

[OUTRO]
You're wrong when you push me down, but I let you and
Someone call the breaking point
Feel like a chance and
Feel like I'm complete
