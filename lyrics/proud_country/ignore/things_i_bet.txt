[CHORUS]
The quick stop
It in sick to the way
This is how to second base
Little map dots
Mirror of you, girl can get
South, yeah, this life I bet
Things I bet
Things I bet
Flip-flops
A little midnight t-top

[VERSE]
This is bottoms up in them blue bug zapper light
Light it on and she's ridin shot gun like
There's a lunatic from her
On, top back find a work
Kind of a country
Ain't nothin' but country
...
