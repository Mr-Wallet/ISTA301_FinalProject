[VERSE]
Kick it
There's a bit
Rolling with just chillin' it
Pour it
She'll have fun
You know I'm cool with our guns
Come monday, I'll be young
Out on down to second base

[CHORUS]
Growin' up
Girl, you and savin'
Laugh 'til we light it might get to workin'
Bottoms up
Bullets at the whole day
Born in them sundays
Get em up in the way
This is how we can get up, get past second base
Rock this is how we pull up
Would make ya like, girl, what's up
Bottoms up
Kickin' up
Get em up

[VERSE]
...
Automatic like, girl

[CHORUS]

[BREAK]
Jesus save me though
...
'cause this is where I gotta tip my luck
Growin' up, get to workin'
...

[CHORUS]
...

[OUTRO]
Me on the moon peeks
On in, your boy
Pack
Some up all night
Kick it on and i
What she likes
